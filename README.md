1. To access my javascript code used for my page, click the contact us (contact.js), and go down the validation pipeline! See how each field makes you meet certain validation credentials to submit. (also, check app.js where I have used javascript to update the year automatically on my footer)

2. The CSS requirements are displayed through my menu animations.
